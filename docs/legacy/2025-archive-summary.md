# Compilation Guide

This guide explains how to compile the Wawona project and its dependencies using Nix.

## Build Commands

We use **Nix Flakes** to manage builds. The general syntax for building a target is:

```bash
nix build .#<target-name> [flags]
```

### Common Flags

- **`-L` (or `--print-build-logs`)**:
  - **What it does**: Prints the full build logs to the terminal as the build proceeds.
  - **When to use**: Use this when a build is failing or taking a long time, and you want to see what is happening (e.g., compiler output, errors).
  - **Example**: `nix build .#waypipe-ios -L`

- **`--show-trace`**:
  - **What it does**: Prints a stack trace if the Nix expression evaluation fails.
  - **When to use**: Use this if you get a generic "error: ..." message from Nix to pinpoint where in the `.nix` files the error occurred.

## Available Targets

The following targets are available for compilation. They are categorized by platform.

### 📱 iOS Targets
These targets compile for `aarch64-apple-ios` using the iOS SDK.

- **`waypipe-ios`**: Compiles Waypipe for iOS (includes bindings for ffmpeg, lz4, zstd).
- **`ffmpeg-ios`**: FFmpeg libraries (avcodec, avutil, etc.) for iOS.
- **`libwayland-ios`**: Wayland client and server libraries for iOS.
- **`kosmickrisp-ios`**: Vulkan-based Wayland compositor support.
- **`lz4-ios`**: LZ4 compression library.
- **`zstd-ios`**: Zstandard compression library.
- **`expat-ios`**: XML parsing library.
- **`libffi-ios`**: Foreign Function Interface library.
- **`libxml2-ios`**: XML C parser and toolkit.
- **`epoll-shim-ios`**: Epoll emulation for BSD systems.

### 💻 macOS Targets
These targets compile for `aarch64-apple-darwin` (macOS).

- **`waypipe-macos`**
- **`ffmpeg-macos`**
- **`libwayland-macos`**
- **`kosmickrisp-macos`**
- **`lz4-macos`**
- **`zstd-macos`**
- **`expat-macos`**
- **`libffi-macos`**
- **`libxml2-macos`**
- **`epoll-shim-macos`**

### 🤖 Android Targets
These targets compile for Android (aarch64).

- **`waypipe-android`**
- **`ffmpeg-android`**
- **`libwayland-android`**
- **`swiftshader-android`**: CPU-based Vulkan implementation.
- **`lz4-android`**
- **`zstd-android`**
- **`expat-android`**
- **`libffi-android`**
- **`libxml2-android`**

## Examples

**Build Waypipe for iOS with logs:**
```bash
nix build .#waypipe-ios -L
```

**Build FFmpeg for Android:**
```bash
nix build .#ffmpeg-android
```

**Run Waypipe on macOS:**
You can run waypipe directly on macOS using `nix run`:
```bash
nix run .#waypipe-macos -- --help
nix run .#waypipe-macos -- --version
nix run .#waypipe-macos -- ssh user@host command
```

**Check the build result:**
By default, `nix build` creates a `result` symlink in the current directory containing the build output (e.g., `result/bin/waypipe`).

```bash
ls -l result/bin/
file result/bin/waypipe
```

# updating dependencies

Most of the dependencies we handle with nix. Such as libffi, libwayland, epoll-shim etc. 

But for our Android build, `nix run .#update-android-deps` is available to update all gradle dependencies. I don't really know if this is the best way to do such a thing. but its there...

# Dependency Management System

## Overview

The dependency management system in `./dependencies` provides a scalable, maintainable way to build dependencies for iOS, macOS, and Android using Nix cross-compilation. Each dependency is self-contained, and platform builders are generic and reusable.

## Structure

```
dependencies/
├── deps/                    # Individual dependency definitions
│   ├── wayland.nix
│   ├── waypipe.nix
│   └── mesa-kosmickrisp.nix
├── platforms/                # Platform-specific build logic
│   ├── ios.nix
│   ├── macos.nix
│   └── android.nix
├── common/                   # Shared utilities
│   ├── common.nix           # Helper functions

    ├── wayland/
    ├── waypipe/
    └── kosmickrisp-vulkan/
```

## Adding a New Dependency

### Step 1: Create Dependency File

Create `dependencies/deps/newdep.nix`:

```nix
{
  source = "github";  # or "gitlab"
  owner = "owner";
  repo = "repo";
  tag = "v1.0.0";     # or rev = "abc123..." or branch = "main"
  sha256 = "sha256-...";
  platforms = [ "ios" "macos" "android" ];
  buildSystem = "meson";  # or "cmake", "cargo", "autotools"
  buildFlags = {
    ios = [ "-Dflag1" "-Dflag2" ];
    macos = [ "-Dflag1" ];
    android = [ "-Dflag1" ];
  };
  patches = {
    ios = [ ../patches/newdep/ios-fix.patch ];
    macos = [];
    android = [];
  };
  dependencies = {
    macos = [ "expat" "libffi" ];
    ios = [ "expat" "libffi" ];
    android = [ "expat" ];
  };
}
```

### Step 2: Register Dependency

Add to `dependencies/common/registry.nix`:

```nix
{
  wayland = import ../deps/wayland.nix;
  waypipe = import ../deps/waypipe.nix;
  "mesa-kosmickrisp" = import ../deps/mesa-kosmickrisp.nix;
  newdep = import ../deps/newdep.nix;
}
```

### Step 3: Build

```bash
nix build --show-trace '.#newdep-macos'
nix build --show-trace '.#newdep-ios'
nix build --show-trace '.#newdep-android'
```

## Dependency Configuration

### Source Options

- `source`: `"github"` or `"gitlab"` (default: `"github"`)
- `owner`: Repository owner
- `repo`: Repository name
- `tag`: Git tag (e.g., `"v1.0.0"`)
- `rev`: Git commit hash (e.g., `"abc123..."`)
- `branch`: Git branch (e.g., `"main"`)
- `sha256`: Source hash (required)

### Build Configuration

- `platforms`: List of platforms: `[ "ios" "macos" "android" ]`
- `buildSystem`: `"meson"`, `"cmake"`, `"cargo"`, `"rust"`, or `"autotools"`
- `buildFlags`: Platform-specific flags
  ```nix
  buildFlags = {
    ios = [ "-Dflag1" "-Dflag2" ];
    macos = [ "-Dflag1" ];
  };
  ```
- `patches`: Platform-specific patches
  ```nix
  patches = {
    ios = [ ../patches/dep/ios-fix.patch ];
    macos = [];
  };
  ```

### Rust/Cargo Specific

- `cargoHash`: Cargo hash (SRI format)
- `cargoSha256`: Legacy cargo hash
- `cargoLock`: Path to Cargo.lock (optional)

### Dependencies

Declare platform-specific dependencies:

```nix
dependencies = {
  macos = [ "expat" "libffi" "libxml2" ];
  ios = [ "expat" "libffi" "libxml2" ];
  android = [ "expat" "libffi" ];
};
```

Supported dependency names:
- `expat`, `libffi`, `libxml2`
- `libclc`, `zlib`, `zstd`, `llvm`

## Platform Builders

Platform builders in `platforms/` are generic and handle all build systems:

- `platforms/ios.nix` - iOS cross-compilation with Xcode integration
- `platforms/macos.nix` - Native macOS builds
- `platforms/android.nix` - Android cross-compilation

Each platform builder:
1. Fetches source using `common.fetchSource`
2. Applies platform-specific patches
3. Resolves dependencies from `entry.dependencies`
4. Builds using the specified build system

## Build Systems

### Meson

```nix
buildSystem = "meson";
buildFlags = {
  macos = [ "-Doption=value" ];
};
```

### CMake

```nix
buildSystem = "cmake";
buildFlags = {
  macos = [ "-DOPTION=value" ];
};
```

### Cargo/Rust

```nix
buildSystem = "cargo";
cargoHash = "sha256-...";
buildFlags = {
  macos = [ "--target=aarch64-apple-darwin" "--features=feature" ];
};
```

### Autotools

```nix
buildSystem = "autotools";
buildFlags = {
  macos = [ "--enable-feature" ];
};
```

## iOS Specifics

### Xcode Integration

iOS builds automatically detect and use Xcode:
- Finds Xcode via `utils/find-xcode.sh`
- Sets `DEVELOPER_DIR`, `SDKROOT`, `PATH`
- Uses Xcode's compiler for iOS builds

### Cross-Compilation

Uses `pkgs.pkgsCross.iphone64` for iOS builds. Dependencies are resolved from `iosPkgs` (e.g., `iosPkgs.expat`).

## Building Dependencies

### Build Single Dependency

```bash
nix build --show-trace '.#wayland-macos'
nix build --show-trace '.#wayland-ios'
nix build --show-trace '.#wayland-android'
```

### Build All Dependencies for Platform

```bash
nix build --show-trace '.#ios'      # All iOS dependencies
nix build --show-trace '.#macos'    # All macOS dependencies
nix build --show-trace '.#android'  # All Android dependencies
```

### Build from Flake

All dependencies are available as flake outputs:

```bash
nix build --show-trace '.#wayland-macos'
nix build --show-trace '.#waypipe-ios'
nix build --show-trace '.#mesa-kosmickrisp-macos'
```

## Scalability

The structure scales to 100+ dependencies:

1. **One file per dependency** - Easy to add/modify without touching other files
2. **Dependencies declared in dependency files** - Self-contained configuration
3. **Platform files are generic** - No hardcoded dependency logic
4. **Registry is simple aggregation** - Just imports all dependencies
5. **Easy to add new platforms** - Create new platform file following the pattern

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "dependency not found"

Ensure the dependency is listed in `entry.dependencies.<platform>` and the dependency name is supported in the platform builder's `getDeps` function.

### iOS Build Fails

- Ensure Xcode is installed
- Check that `utils/find-xcode.sh` can find Xcode
- Verify iOS SDK is available

### Hash Mismatch

Update `sha256` in the dependency file. Nix will show the correct hash on first build.

## Examples

See existing dependencies for examples:
- `deps/wayland.nix` - Meson build with dependencies
- `deps/waypipe.nix` - Cargo/Rust build
- `deps/mesa-kosmickrisp.nix` - Complex Meson build with many flags

# Wawona Project Goals

Wawona aims to be **THE** Wayland compositor for macOS. It serves as the central hub for downstream patches and fixes for the entire Wayland ecosystem on macOS (including Wayland, Waypipe, and other core dependencies), with the ultimate goal of upstreaming these improvements.

## Vision

1.  **The Definitive macOS Wayland Experience**
    - Establish Wawona as the standard, "proper" Wayland compositor for macOS.
    - Foster mass adoption and build a collaborative open-source community.
    - Aspire for industry backing (Apple, Google, etc.) as the project matures.

2.  **Cross-Platform Stability**
    - Deliver a stable, mature Wayland compositor for **macOS, iOS, and Android** within the next 5 years.
    - Ensure a shared, maintainable codebase across all three platforms (C/Objective-C/Rust/JNI).

3.  **Modern & Forward-Looking**
    - **No X11 / XWayland Support**: Strictly focus on forward-moving applications adopting native Wayland protocols.
    - **Target Modern OS Versions**: Focus exclusively on **macOS 26+** and **iOS 26+**. Legacy support is not a priority.
    - **Clean Codebase**: Prioritize code cleanliness, readability, and maintainability. Avoid "vibecoded" hacks; strive for professional-grade engineering.

## Technical Objectives

### Build & Infrastructure
-   **Nix Build System**: Utilize Nix exclusively for hermetic, reproducible builds.
-   **Host Platform**: Compilation is supported **only on Apple Silicon macOS**. No support for Linux or x86_64 macOS hosts.
-   **Testing**: Validation on real hardware and simulators (iOS Simulator, Android Emulator).

### Graphics & Rendering
-   **Vulkan Compliance**: Strict adherence to Vulkan standards. No compromises for Metal-specific constraints (MoltenVK/MoltenGL details are implementation details, but the goal is Vulkan conformance).
-   **Future Android Support**: Bring support to Adreno/Freedreno/Turnip for supported Android chipsets.
-   **OpenGL/GLX**: Enable working OpenGL/GLX support moving forward.
-   **Zero-Copy**: Achieve near-zero-copy rendering for Waypipe clients to maximize performance and minimize CPU usage.

### Ecosystem & Features
-   **Full Protocol Support**: Support **ALL** Wayland protocols (Core, Wlroots, KDE, etc.) to ensure compatibility with a wide range of compositors and clients.
-   **Desktop Environments**: Enable support for major desktops and compositors:
    -   Sway
    -   Niri
    -   GNOME Desktop
    -   Plasma KDE
    -   Phosh
-   **Bundled Weston**: Bundle a natively compiled Weston as a nested compositor for macOS, iOS, and Android.
-   **Native Integration**: Deep integration into the macOS desktop environment.

### Deployment & Restrictions
-   **Zero Limitations**: The project prioritizes functionality over App Store restrictions. It will not be limited by App Store policies.
-   **Sandboxing**: Adopt platform sandboxing on iOS and Android where appropriate, but remain unencumbered on macOS.

## Community & Sustainability

-   **Collaborative Effort**: This project relies on the community. Contributions and donations are vital.
-   **Upstreaming**: Act as a staging ground for macOS/iOS patches to be upstreamed to their respective projects.

# Wawona iOS Process Spawning Implementation Status

## Summary

Wawona implements a process spawning system for iOS that allows spawning processes (waypipe, ssh, hello_world) on jailed iOS devices using app extensions.

## Architecture

### Two Communication Paths

1. **Direct NSExtension API** (WawonaKernel)
   - Uses `NSExtension` API directly
   - Sends spawn requests via `beginExtensionRequestWithInputItems:`
   - Extension receives request and executes via `WawonaShim`
   - Used for: Simple process spawning

2. **Socket-Based IPC** (WawonaWaypipeRunner)
   - Extension starts Unix domain socket server
   - Main app connects to socket
   - JSON protocol for commands (spawn, ping, signal)
   - Used for: Waypipe with stdout/stderr capture

### Extension Entry Point

The extension (`WawonaSSHRunner.appex`) handles both modes:

```objective-c
- (void)beginRequestWithExtensionContext:(NSExtensionContext *)context {
    NSDictionary *appInfo = context.inputItems.firstObject.userInfo;
    
    if ([appInfo[@"LSServiceMode"] isEqualToString:@"spawn"]) {
        // Direct execution mode (WawonaKernel)
        [WawonaShim beginGuestExecutionWithInfo:appInfo];
    } else {
        // Socket server mode (WawonaWaypipeRunner)
        [self ensureSocketServerStarted];
    }
}
```

## Key Components

### 1. WawonaKernel (`src/core/WawonaKernel.m`)
- ✅ Implements virtual process management
- ✅ Uses NSExtension API for spawning
- ✅ Maps virtual PIDs to physical PIDs
- ⚠️ **Issue**: Tries to get PID via private API (may not work)

### 2. WawonaSSHRunner Extension (`src/extensions/WawonaSSHRunner/`)
- ✅ Implements socket server for IPC
- ✅ Handles posix_spawn with proper attributes
- ✅ Captures stdout/stderr and forwards to main app
- ✅ Supports multiple concurrent processes
- ✅ Handles process exit codes

### 3. WawonaShim (`src/extensions/WawonaSSHRunner/WawonaShim.m`)
- ✅ Guest execution shim
- ✅ Overwrites NSBundle and executable path
- ✅ Loads binary via dlopen and jumps to main
- ✅ Sets up environment variables

### 4. WawonaWaypipeRunner (`src/ui/Settings/WawonaWaypipeRunner.m`)
- ✅ Connects to extension socket
- ✅ Sends spawn commands via JSON
- ✅ Receives stdout/stderr output
- ✅ Handles process lifecycle

## What Works ✅

1. **Extension Loading**: Extension loads and starts correctly
2. **Socket Communication**: Unix socket IPC works reliably
3. **Process Spawning**: posix_spawn works in extension context
4. **Output Capture**: stdout/stderr captured and forwarded
5. **Process Management**: Multiple processes can run concurrently
6. **Guest Execution**: WawonaShim loads and executes binaries

## Potential Issues ⚠️

### 1. Code Signing
- **Issue**: May need code signing bypass for unsigned binaries
- **Impact**: May prevent spawning unsigned binaries
- **Status**: Need to test if Wawona needs this
- **Action**: Test spawning unsigned binaries

### 2. PID Retrieval
- **Issue**: WawonaKernel tries to get PID via private API
- **Impact**: May return -1 if API not available
- **Status**: Works but may need fallback
- **Action**: Add fallback mechanism

### 3. Extension Lifecycle
- **Issue**: Extension may terminate if no activity
- **Impact**: Socket connection may fail
- **Status**: Current retry logic handles this
- **Action**: Monitor for issues

### 4. App Group Configuration
- **Issue**: Requires App Group entitlement
- **Impact**: Must be configured in Xcode/entitlements
- **Status**: ✅ Configured correctly
- **Action**: Verify in build system

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Extension loads successfully
- [ ] Socket server starts
- [ ] Main app connects to socket
- [ ] Ping command works

### Process Spawning
- [ ] `hello_world` spawns successfully
- [ ] `ssh` spawns successfully
- [ ] `waypipe` spawns successfully
- [ ] Multiple processes can run concurrently

### Output Handling
- [ ] stdout captured correctly
- [ ] stderr captured correctly
- [ ] Output forwarded to main app
- [ ] Process exit codes reported

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid binary path handled
- [ ] Missing binary handled
- [ ] Extension crash handled
- [ ] Socket disconnection handled

## Build System Integration

### Required Components

1. **Extension Target**
   - Compile `WawonaSSHRunner.m`
   - Link Foundation framework
   - Bundle `Info.plist` and `Entitlements.plist`
   - Code sign with entitlements

2. **App Group**
   - Configure `group.com.aspauldingcode.Wawona`
   - Add to both main app and extension entitlements

3. **Binary Bundling**
   - Copy `ssh` to `bin/ssh` in app bundle
   - Copy `waypipe` to `bin/waypipe` in app bundle
   - Copy `hello_world` to `bin/hello_world` in app bundle

### Nix Build Integration

The extension needs to be:
1. Compiled as separate target
2. Bundled into `Wawona.app/PlugIns/WawonaSSHRunner.appex/`
3. Code-signed with entitlements
4. Linked with Foundation framework

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Build System**
   - Ensure extension is built and bundled
   - Verify code signing works
   - Check App Group configuration

2. **Test Process Spawning**
   - Test on iOS Simulator
   - Test on real iOS device
   - Verify all three binaries work

3. **Add Code Signing Bypass** (if needed)
   - Implement code signing bypass equivalent
   - Test with unsigned binaries

4. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Add better error messages
   - Improve retry logic
   - Add logging

## Conclusion

Wawona's implementation is **functionally complete** and should work for spawning processes on jailed iOS. The architecture uses:

1. **App Extensions**: Separate process with spawn permissions
2. **Socket-based IPC**: Unix sockets for flexible communication
3. **Direct posix_spawn**: Standard POSIX process spawning

**All core functionality is present and should work correctly.**

The key is ensuring the build system properly:
- ✅ Builds the extension
- ✅ Bundles it correctly
- ✅ Code signs it
- ✅ Configures App Group

==> ios-waypipe-status.md <==
# iOS Waypipe Implementation Status

## Current State: iOS Simulator Limitation Identified

### What Works ✅
- OpenSSH compiled for iOS Simulator (arm64)
- SSH binary properly code-signed
- DYLD_ROOT_PATH environment setup
- Waypipe compiled for iOS
- All dependencies packaged correctly

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **`posix_spawn` fails with EACCES** (Permission denied) in iOS Simulator
- SSH cannot be spawned from main app
- Waypipe cannot spawn SSH subprocess

### Root Cause

**iOS Simulator blocks `posix_spawn` for third-party executables** as a security measure.

Evidence from testing:
```
Direct SSH test - spawn failed: 13 (Permission denied)
```

Even though:
- ✅ DYLD_ROOT_PATH is set correctly
- ✅ SSH binary has 755 permissions  
- ✅ SSH is code-signed with entitlements
- ✅ SSH works from command line (with DYLD_ROOT_PATH)
- ✅ posix_spawnattr properly configured

The iOS Simulator **intentionally blocks spawning** for sandboxed apps.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Test on Real iOS Device ⚡ (Recommended to Try First)

Real iOS devices have different spawning rules. The current implementation might work there.

**What to test:**
1. Build and install on real iPhone/iPad
2. Try running waypipe
3. SSH spawning may succeed on device where it fails in simulator

### Option 2: App Extension Approach 🏗️ (Implemented)

Using iOS App Extensions for process spawning on jailed devices.

**Files Created:**
- `src/extensions/WawonaSSHRunner/WawonaSSHRunner.m` - Extension that spawns processes
- `src/extensions/WawonaSSHRunner/WawonaSSHRunnerProtocol.h` - XPC protocol
- `src/extensions/WawonaSSHRunner/Info.plist` - Extension metadata
- `src/extensions/WawonaSSHRunner/Entitlements.plist` - Permissions

**How it Works:**
```
Main App → XPC request → Extension (separate process) → posix_spawn SSH ✅
```

App extensions CAN spawn subprocesses where main apps cannot!

**Status:** Code written and integrated into build system.

See: `docs/implementation-status.md` for full details.

### Option 3: Revert to libssh2 🔄 (Fallback)

Use libssh2 as an embedded library instead of spawning SSH.

**Pros:**
- No process spawning needed
- Works in simulator
- Already attempted earlier

**Cons:**
- More complex integration
- Requires patching waypipe to use libssh2 instead of SSH binary

## Technical Details

### App Extension Approach Explained

Wawona solves the iOS spawning limitation with **App Extensions**:

1. **NSExtension API** - iOS blessed way to create separate processes
2. **XPC Communication** - Extension receives spawn requests from main app
3. **posix_spawn in Extension** - Works because extension is a separate process with different permissions
4. **Code Signing** - Extension can sign unsigned binaries before spawning

Key architecture:
```objective-c
// Guest (in extension):
pid_t spawn_process_at_path(...) {
    // posix_spawn works here!
}

// Host (main app):
_extension = [NSExtension extensionWithIdentifier:...];
[_extension beginExtensionRequestWithInputItems:...];
// Extension now runs as separate process and can spawn!
```

## Current Build

The latest build includes:
- ✅ DYLD_ROOT_PATH setup for simulator
- ✅ posix_spawnattr configuration
- ✅ Enhanced error logging
- ✅ Documentation of iOS limitation
- ✅ Extension built and bundled

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Test on real iOS device - may work without extension
2. **Short-term:** Verify extension integration works end-to-end
3. **Long-term:** Full kernel virtualization layer for complex scenarios

## Files to Review

- `docs/implementation-status.md` - Implementation guide
- `src/extensions/WawonaSSHRunner/` - Extension source code
- `src/ui/Settings/WawonaWaypipeRunner.m` - Updated with DYLD and extension support

## Key Insight

**iOS Simulator is fundamentally limited** for security. Production use requires either:
- Real iOS device testing
- App extension architecture
- Embedded library approach (no spawning)

The extension approach is the most elegant and is now implemented in Wawona.

# Wawona iOS Kernel Testing

## Overview

The Wawona iOS Kernel test suite validates process spawning capabilities on jailed iOS devices using the app extension architecture.

## Running Tests

### Command

```bash
nix run .#wawona-kernel-ios
```

This command:
1. Builds the iOS app with kernel test mode enabled
2. Launches iOS Simulator
3. Installs and runs the app
4. Automatically runs comprehensive kernel tests

### What Gets Tested

The kernel test suite validates three critical components:

1. **hello_world** - Basic binary spawning
   - Tests: Process spawning via extension
   - Validates: Basic posix_spawn functionality

2. **ssh** - OpenSSH binary spawning
   - Tests: SSH binary execution
   - Validates: Complex binary spawning with dependencies

3. **waypipe** - Waypipe binary spawning
   - Tests: Waypipe execution
   - Validates: Full process spawning with environment setup

## Test Implementation

### Test Flow

```
Main App (Wawona)
  ↓ WAWONA_KERNEL_TEST=1
  ↓ [WawonaKernel runKernelTests]
  ↓ Test 1: hello_world
  ↓ Test 2: ssh  
  ↓ Test 3: waypipe
  ↓ Results logged
```

### Test Code Location

- **Test Implementation**: `src/core/WawonaKernelTests.m`
- **Test Header**: `src/core/WawonaKernelTests.h`
- **Test Trigger**: `src/core/main.m` (checks `WAWONA_KERNEL_TEST` env var)

### Environment Variables

The test is controlled by environment variables:

- `WAWONA_KERNEL_TEST=1` - Enables kernel test mode
- `WAWONA_IOS_FOLLOW_LOGS=1` - Follows logs in real-time
- `WAWONA_IOS_LOG_LEVEL=debug` - Sets log level to debug

## Expected Output

When tests run successfully, you should see:

```
[WawonaKernel] ========================================
[WawonaKernel] Starting Comprehensive Kernel Tests
[WawonaKernel] ========================================
[WawonaKernel] Test 1: Spawning hello_world
[WawonaKernel] ✅ hello_world spawned successfully with PID: <pid>
[WawonaKernel] Test 2: Spawning ssh
[WawonaKernel] ✅ ssh spawned successfully with PID: <pid>
[WawonaKernel] Test 3: Spawning waypipe
[WawonaKernel] ✅ waypipe spawned successfully with PID: <pid>
[WawonaKernel] ========================================
[WawonaKernel] Kernel Tests Completed
[WawonaKernel] ========================================
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Don't Run

1. **Check environment variable**: Ensure `WAWONA_KERNEL_TEST=1` is set
2. **Check extension**: Verify `WawonaSSHRunner.appex` is built and bundled
3. **Check binaries**: Ensure `hello_world`, `ssh`, and `waypipe` are in `bin/` directory

### Spawn Failures

1. **Check logs**: Look for error messages in simulator logs
2. **Check code signing**: Ensure extension and binaries are properly signed
3. **Check App Group**: Verify `group.com.aspauldingcode.Wawona` is configured

### Extension Not Found

1. **Check bundle**: Verify extension is in `PlugIns/WawonaSSHRunner.appex/`
2. **Check Info.plist**: Verify extension identifier matches
3. **Check entitlements**: Ensure App Group is configured

## Architecture

The kernel tests use the same architecture as production:

- **Main App**: Initiates spawn requests via `WawonaKernel`
- **Extension**: Receives requests and executes `posix_spawn`
- **Process**: Spawned with proper environment and arguments

This validates that the entire process spawning pipeline works correctly.

```

---

## Comparison Summary

### ✅ What We Got Right

1. **Build Flags**: All meson options match the standard build
2. **Dependencies**: All required dependencies are included
3. **Shared Library Output**: `--default-library=shared` ensures .dylib files
4. **Metal Framework Linking**: Properly configured for macOS/iOS
5. **Cross-Compilation**: iOS setup follows standard Meson cross-file approach
6. **PKG_CONFIG_PATH**: Properly configured for SPIRV dependencies

### ⚠️ Potential Issues / Differences

1. **libclc Dependency**:
   - **Standard**: May be optional for kosmickrisp (Vulkan-only, no OpenCL)
   - **Our Setup**: Currently included, but causing clangBasic linking issues
   - **Action**: Investigate if kosmickrisp actually needs libclc

2. **clangBasic Library Issue**:
   - **Problem**: Mesa's meson.build requires `clangBasic` when libclc is present
   - **Standard Build**: Would have same issue if libclc is installed
   - **Action**: Either:
     a) Make libclc optional/disable it for kosmickrisp
     b) Fix clangBasic detection in Mesa's meson.build
     c) Ensure Clang libraries are properly exposed

3. **Missing from Standard Examples**:
   - Standard examples don't show explicit Metal framework linking (auto-detected)
   - Our explicit `-framework` flags are fine, but may be redundant

### 🔍 Investigation Results

**✅ CONFIRMED: kosmickrisp DOES need libclc**

From Mesa's `meson.build`:
```meson
with_driver_using_cl = [
  with_gallium_iris, with_intel_vk,
  with_gallium_asahi, with_asahi_vk, with_tools.contains('asahi'),
  with_gallium_panfrost, with_panfrost_vk,
  with_nouveau_vk, with_imagination_vk,
  with_kosmickrisp_vk,  # <-- kosmickrisp is listed here!
].contains(true)

with_clc = get_option('mesa-clc') != 'auto' or \
           with_microsoft_clc or with_gallium_rusticl or \
           with_drivers_clc or with_driver_using_cl  # <-- includes kosmickrisp

dep_clc = null_dep
if with_clc
  dep_clc = dependency('libclc')  # <-- Required when kosmickrisp is enabled
endif
```

**✅ CONFIRMED: clangBasic requirement comes from libclc**

From Mesa's `meson.build`:
```meson
if with_clc
  llvm_libdir = dep_llvm.get_variable(cmake : 'LLVM_LIBRARY_DIR', configtool: 'libdir')
  
  dep_clang = cpp.find_library('clang-cpp', dirs : llvm_libdir, required : false)
  
  if not dep_clang.found() or not _shared_llvm
    clang_modules = [
      'clangBasic', 'clangAST', 'clangCodeGen', ...  # <-- Falls back to individual modules
    ]
```

**The Problem:**
- Mesa first tries to find `clang-cpp` library
- If not found, it tries individual Clang modules (`clangBasic`, etc.)
- Our Nix setup has Clang but Mesa can't find the libraries

**The Problem:**
- Mesa first tries to find `clang-cpp` library via `cpp.find_library('clang-cpp', dirs : llvm_libdir)`
- `llvm_libdir` comes from `dep_llvm.get_variable(configtool: 'libdir')` which uses `llvm-config --libdir`
- In nixpkgs, Clang libraries are NOT in LLVM's libdir - they're separate packages
- When `clang-cpp` isn't found, Mesa falls back to individual modules (`clangBasic`, etc.)
- But those modules also need to be in `llvm_libdir` or Mesa can't find them

**The Solution:**
We need to ensure Clang libraries are findable where Mesa expects them. Options:

1. **Symlink Clang libraries into LLVM libdir** (during build):
   ```nix
   preConfigure = ''
     # Symlink Clang libs to where Mesa expects them (LLVM libdir)
     LLVM_LIBDIR="${pkgs.llvmPackages.llvm.lib}/lib"
     CLANG_LIBDIR="${pkgs.llvmPackages.clang.lib}/lib"
     for lib in $CLANG_LIBDIR/libclang*.dylib $CLANG_LIBDIR/libclang*.a; do
       if [ -f "$lib" ]; then
         ln -sf "$lib" "$LLVM_LIBDIR/$(basename $lib)"
       fi
     done
   '';
   ```

2. **Use meson's dirs parameter** - Patch Mesa's meson.build to also search Clang libdir

3. **Ensure Clang is in buildInputs** - Already done, but may need explicit library paths

4. **Check if nixpkgs LLVM includes Clang** - May need to use a different LLVM package that includes Clang

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Test Standard Build Locally (to verify it works)
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa.git
cd mesa

# Install dependencies via Homebrew
brew install llvm spirv-tools spirv-headers spirv-llvm-translator libclc
pip3 install mako pyyaml

# Build kosmickrisp
meson setup builddir \
  --prefix=/usr/local \
  --libdir=lib \
  -Dvulkan-drivers=kosmickrisp \
  -Dgallium-drivers= \
  -Dplatforms= \
  -Dglx=disabled \
  -Degl=disabled \
  -Dgbm=disabled \
  -Dtools= \
  -Dvulkan-beta=true \
  -Dbuildtype=release \
  --default-library=shared

ninja -C builddir
```

**Expected Result**: Should build successfully if Clang libraries are available

### 2. Fix clangBasic Issue in Nix

**Root Cause**: Mesa's meson.build looks for Clang C++ libraries (`clangBasic`, `clangAST`, etc.) in the directory returned by `llvm-config --libdir`. In nixpkgs, these libraries may not be in that location or may not be built as shared libraries.

**Solutions**:

**Option A: Patch Mesa's meson.build** (Recommended)
Create a patch that makes Clang library detection more flexible:
```nix
patches = [
  (pkgs.writeText "mesa-clang-libdir.patch" ''
    diff --git a/meson.build b/meson.build
    index... 
    --- a/meson.build
    +++ b/meson.build
    @@ -XXX,XXX +XXX,XXX @@
    -  dep_clang = cpp.find_library('clang-cpp', dirs : llvm_libdir, required : false)
    +  # Also search in common Clang library locations
    +  clang_libdirs = [llvm_libdir]
    +  if get_option('clang-libdir') != ''
    +    clang_libdirs += [get_option('clang-libdir')]
    +  endif
    +  dep_clang = cpp.find_library('clang-cpp', dirs : clang_libdirs, required : false)
  '')
];
```

**Option B: Ensure Clang libraries are available**
- Check if nixpkgs LLVM includes Clang C++ libraries
- If not, build Clang with shared libraries enabled
- Or use a different LLVM package that includes Clang

**Option C: Use Mesa's system libclc option**
- Set `-Dmesa-clc=system` and provide a pre-built libclc
- This might avoid the Clang library requirement

### 3. Verify Our Configuration Matches Standard

**✅ Confirmed Matches:**
- All meson build flags are identical
- Dependencies match standard requirements
- Cross-compilation setup follows Meson conventions
- Metal framework linking is correct

**⚠️ Known Difference:**
- Clang library detection issue (affects both standard and Nix if Clang libs aren't in expected location)

---

## Standard Build Command (Reference)

```bash
# macOS - Standard way
meson setup builddir \
  --prefix=/usr/local \
  --libdir=lib \
  -Dvulkan-drivers=kosmickrisp \
  -Dgallium-drivers= \
  -Dplatforms= \
  -Dglx=disabled \
  -Degl=disabled \
  -Dgbm=disabled \
  -Dtools= \
  -Dvulkan-beta=true \
  -Dbuildtype=release \
  --default-library=shared

ninja -C builddir
```

**Our Nix equivalent:**
```nix
meson setup build \
  --prefix=$out \
  --libdir=$out/lib \
  -Dvulkan-drivers=kosmickrisp \
  -Dgallium-drivers= \
  -Dplatforms= \
  -Dglx=disabled \
  -Degl=disabled \
  -Dgbm=disabled \
  -Dtools= \
  -Dvulkan-beta=true \
  -Dbuildtype=release \
  --default-library=shared
```

**✅ Configuration is identical!** The only issue is Clang library detection, which is a dependency/environment issue, not a configuration problem.

==> kosmickrisp.md <==
Nice — I searched upstream Mesa and the KosmicKrisp announcements and pulled together a concrete, source-backed inventory of what you need to build **KosmicKrisp (KosmicKrisp = LunarG’s Vulkan→Metal Mesa driver)** on **macOS**, what the driver’s build-time library dependencies are, and what it needs at runtime.

I couldn’t find a single “one-line” manifest in the announcements, so I compiled the lists from the Mesa build docs/meson files and LunarG/Khronos/Phoronix announcements (links cited inline). Where something is optional or platform-specific I call that out and point to how to confirm it from upstream.

---

# Short summary (high level)

* KosmicKrisp is a **Mesa Vulkan driver** that translates Vulkan to **Apple Metal** and has been published/announced by LunarG and upstreamed to Mesa. ([LunarG][1])
* Building it on macOS uses **Mesa’s Meson/Ninja build**; you must satisfy the usual Mesa build toolchain plus the Vulkan shader/SPIR-V toolchain and a few Apple tool/framework requirements (Xcode SDK/Metal). ([docs.mesa3d.org][2])

---

# A. **Build-tools / toolchain (what to install to *build* KosmicKrisp on macOS)**

These are the *tools* (programs, build system components, SDKs) you need before configuring/building Mesa with `-Dvulkan-drivers=kosmickrisp`:

1. **Xcode Command Line Tools / macOS SDK** — clang/clang++ toolchain and system headers (required to compile C/C++ and link against system frameworks like Metal). *(install via `xcode-select --install`)*. (Required). ([LunarG][1])
2. **git** — to clone upstream Mesa. ([docs.mesa3d.org][3])
3. **Python 3** (python3) and `pip` — Meson is a Python tool; Mesa build uses Python for codegen. ([mesonbuild.com][4])
4. **meson** (recent version; install with `pip3 install --user meson` or via Homebrew). Mesa’s docs require Meson for the modern build. ([docs.mesa3d.org][2])
5. **ninja** — Meson’s default backend. (`brew install ninja` or `pipx` package wrappers). ([mesonbuild.com][4])
6. **pkg-config** — Meson + many deps use pkg-config. (`brew install pkg-config`). ([mesonbuild.com][4])
7. **Mako Python module** (`pip3 install mako`) — Mesa templates depend on it. Mesa macOS notes explicitly mention Mako. ([docs.mesa3d.org][5])
8. **Flex and Bison** — used for some generated parsers; Meson docs and Mesa note them as build requirements in some configurations. (`brew install flex bison`). ([docs.mesa3d.org][2])
9. **(optional / conditional) LLVM toolchain** — some Mesa subcomponents (and optional shader compiler backends) use LLVM; Meson has `-Dllvm=enabled/disabled` options. Install via `brew install llvm` if you want the LLVM-based parts. (Optional but commonly required for full feature builds). ([gensoft.pasteur.fr][6])

Practical Homebrew-ish install line (example):
`xcode-select --install` then, roughly:
`brew install git python3 meson ninja pkg-config flex bison llvm spirv-tools spirv-headers glslang`
and `pip3 install --user mako meson` (meson usually via pip or brew). (I list the package names below in the library section too). ([Homebrew Formulae][7])

---

# B. **Build-time library / third-party dependencies used when building the *KosmicKrisp* driver inside Mesa**

These are the libraries/dependencies Mesa expects to find when building **Vulkan drivers** and — specifically — what KosmicKrisp reuses from Mesa upstream. (Where upstream makes something required, I cite the Meson dependency usage in Mesa.)

**Required / strongly expected at build time** (driver will not configure if these are missing):

1. **SPIRV-Tools** (`SPIRV-Tools`) — Mesa’s meson build checks for this and it is required for Vulkan driver builds (assembler/validator/optimizer for SPIR-V). Homebrew: `brew install spirv-tools`. ([GitHub][8])
2. **SPIRV-Headers** — headers for SPIR-V. (Often a build dependency together with SPIRV-Tools). ([Linux From Scratch][9])
3. **glslang** (glslangValidator) — used by many Vulkan stacks to compile GLSL to SPIR-V during tests/tooling; commonly pulled in for build/test flows. (Homebrew: `glslang` / `glslangValidator` packages). ([LunarXchange][10])
4. **zlib, expat** — standard small libraries used by Mesa build system (zlib for compression, expat for XML parsing in some tools). (Common Mesa deps). ([Mesa Documentation][11])
5. **Python modules used by Meson/Mesa** — `mako`, `packaging` (already noted above). ([docs.mesa3d.org][2])

**Mesa / Vulkan-driver specific pieces that KosmicKrisp relies on (in-tree or as usual dependencies):**

6. **Mesa’s NIR + in-tree shader toolchain** — KosmicKrisp intentionally leverages Mesa’s NIR IR and in-tree tools to remove the need for SPIRV-Cross. Upstream presentation explicitly mentions NIR and removing SPIRV-Cross. (This is why some SPIR-V→NIR tooling is required at build time). ([The Khronos Group][12])
7. **(possible) SPIRV-LLVM-Translator / SPIRV-LLVM (optional)** — depends on your Meson options and whether LLVMPIR translation is used; many distributions include it for completeness. (Optional depending on build flags). ([Linux From Scratch][9])

**Optional / configuration-dependent deps you may see in `meson configure` for kosmickrisp:**

8. **LLVM if you enable llvm backends** (see Meson options `-Dllvm=`). ([gensoft.pasteur.fr][6])
9. **libdrm / libepoxy / X11 / Wayland** — *not required on macOS for the Metal-based path*, but Mesa’s meson options include them for other drivers; on macOS these are usually disabled. (You will see these listed by Meson if you try to build other plumbing). ([docs.mesa3d.org][13])

**Where to confirm exact, current build-time deps for the version you’re using:** clone upstream Mesa and run Meson configure (Meson prints required/missing deps). Upstream source + meson.options / meson.build are authoritative. Example: `git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa.git && meson setup build -Dvulkan-drivers=kosmickrisp && meson configure build`. The Mesa docs explain this workflow. ([docs.mesa3d.org][3])

---

# C. **Runtime dependencies of KosmicKrisp driver on macOS (what must be present on the *target* machine when you run apps using KosmicKrisp)**

These are the libraries/frameworks the driver needs at runtime (what the driver calls into on a running macOS system):

1. **Apple Metal framework** — KosmicKrisp translates Vulkan calls to Metal; it *runs on top of Metal*, so the system **Metal.framework** is a hard runtime dependency. (LunarG explicitly states KosmicKrisp translates Vulkan to Apple Metal and targets macOS 13/15 baselines.) ([LunarG][1])

2. **macOS system frameworks / runtime (CoreFoundation, CoreGraphics as typical)** — standard system frameworks used by drivers and Mesa plumbing. (Implicit; provided by macOS.) ([LunarG][1])

3. **IOSurface (and related frameworks) — likely/commonly used for texture/buffer sharing**

   * Rationale:* Metal textures can be backed by IOSurface for efficient sharing and zero-copy. Many cross-process/VM/guest→host buffer schemes on macOS use IOSurface. A Vulkan→Metal driver that needs shared buffers (for example when integrating with VMs or compositors) will commonly use IOSurface APIs at runtime. Apple docs show `makeTexture(descriptor: iosurface: plane:)` and IOSurface is the canonical system facility for sharing pixel buffers on macOS. If KosmicKrisp implements things like WSI/texture import or VM buffer exchange, IOSurface will be involved. (Labelled **likely** — check mesa WSI/metal backend code to see which exact APIs are used). ([Apple Developer][14])

4. **(Possibly) Video/CoreVideo/CoreMedia frameworks** — if the driver (or tests) interoperate with video/decoder pipelines, these frameworks may be used — but this is scenario dependent. (Optional.) ([Apple Developer][15])

5. **No external Vulkan loader binary required for Mesa driver itself** — the usual model is that Mesa builds a Vulkan ICD (driver) library that is enumerated by the Vulkan loader (on systems where a loader is used). On macOS the runtime arrangement depends on how you package: LunarG also ships a Vulkan SDK and loader pieces; LunarG’s Vulkan SDK packaging and their KosmicKrisp work are coordinated. In short: at runtime you need the loader/environment that will find the ICD built from Mesa — LunarG’s SDK handles that for app integration. ([LunarG][16])

---

# D. **Concrete, actionable commands & how to confirm exactly for the upstream tree you’ll build**

1. Clone upstream Mesa (authoritative):

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa.git
cd mesa
```

2. Install build tools (example macOS / Homebrew quick list):

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install git python3 meson ninja pkg-config flex bison spirv-tools spirv-headers glslang
pip3 install --user mako
```

(Adjust for LLVM if you enable `-Dllvm=enabled`.) ([docs.mesa3d.org][5])

3. Configure Meson for KosmicKrisp (example):

```bash
meson setup build -Dvulkan-drivers=kosmickrisp -Dgallium-drivers= -Dplatforms=osx
meson configure build   # shows which dependencies are found / missing
meson compile -C build
sudo meson install -C build
```

Meson prints missing/optional deps and the active options; that’s the single-source way to know the exact deps for the exact Mesa commit you built. ([docs.mesa3d.org][2])

---

# E. **Where I got this / important source references (most relevant upstream sources)**

* LunarG KosmicKrisp announcement and XDC slides (overview + Mac / Metal target details). ([LunarG][1])
* Mesa build docs / Meson instructions (how Mesa builds on macOS; Meson & Ninja; Mako requirement). ([docs.mesa3d.org][2])
* Mesa meson.build references showing SPIRV-Tools as a Meson dependency for Vulkan toolchain. ([GitHub][8])
* Homebrew `spirv-tools` formula (practical install). ([Homebrew Formulae][7])
* Apple docs for **IOSurface** and Metal texture APIs (why IOSurface is likely a runtime requirement for zero-copy textures on macOS). ([Apple Developer][17])
* News coverage / upstream merge notes showing KosmicKrisp merged into Mesa (Phoronix / news / repo logs). ([Phoronix][18])

---

# F. **Caveats / recommended next steps**

* **Exact dependencies change with Mesa commit / Meson options.** The authoritative source is the exact Mesa commit you intend to build — `meson configure` will show “found / missing” dependencies for that tree. I strongly recommend cloning the exact upstream Mesa commit and running `meson configure` to get the guaranteed inventory. (Meson prints the list and which ones are required vs optional). ([docs.mesa3d.org][2])

* **Runtime nuance:** KosmicKrisp is *a* Mesa Vulkan driver that targets Metal — that makes **Metal.framework** an inescapable runtime requirement. Other macOS kernel or compositor integration details (IOSurface, CVPixelBuffer, compositor glue) depend on which features WSI / VM / emulator integrations you need; inspect the *wsi/metal* and *vulkan/kosmic* code in the Mesa tree for exact runtime API usage. (I can fetch the exact files / code lines if you want me to extract them from the current upstream Mesa commit.) ([Freedesktop][19])

---

If you want, I can do one of the following *right now* (pick one and I’ll run it and paste the results):

* A. Clone the current upstream Mesa tree (I’ll use the public freedesktop repo) and run `meson configure` (read the meson options) for the commit that contains `kosmickrisp` and extract the exact Meson options and dependency names (the authoritative list for that commit).
* B. Open the exact Mesa files that add KosmicKrisp (wsi/metal and the kosmickrisp driver src) and list the `#include`/linking references that reveal explicit runtime frameworks/APIs used (e.g., `#import <Metal/Metal.h>`, `IOSurface.h`, etc.). That will let us enumerate exact runtime frameworks (Metal, IOSurface, etc.) used by the driver code.
* C. Give a ready-to-paste Homebrew + pip install script tailored to the current upstream Mesa + KosmicKrisp so you can start a build locally.

Tell me which of A / B / C you want and I’ll fetch the exact upstream files and give a precise, line-by-line list (this will remove any remaining uncertainty about optional vs required items).

# Nix Build System Conversion

## Summary

This document describes the conversion of Wawona from CMakeLists.txt to a pure Nix build system.

## Changes Made

### 1. macOS Dependency Changes Analysis

The git diff shows that macOS dependencies were changed to:
- **Removed**: `apple-sdk_26` package dependency
- **Added**: Xcode auto-detection using `xcode-wrapper.nix`
- **Changed**: Deployment targets (some from 26.0 to 13.0, some still 26.0)
- **Improved**: Better handling of autotools packages with proper configure/build/install phases
- **Fixed**: libwayland macOS compatibility (epoll-shim integration, socket defines)

**Reason**: The `apple-sdk_26` package was likely causing compatibility issues or wasn't available. Using Xcode auto-detection provides better compatibility with the user's actual Xcode installation.

### 2. Pure Nix Build System (`dependencies/wawona.nix`)

Created a comprehensive Nix build system that replaces CMakeLists.txt:

#### Features:
- **Version reading**: Reads version from VERSION file
- **Source file management**: Lists all source files from CMakeLists.txt
- **Platform-specific builds**: Separate derivations for macOS, iOS, Android
- **Metal shader compilation**: Compiles Metal shaders to .metallib
- **App bundle creation**: Creates proper iOS/macOS app bundles with Info.plist
- **Dependency handling**: Properly links all dependencies via pkg-config
- **Framework linking**: Links Apple frameworks (Cocoa, Metal, etc.)
- **libgbm wrapper**: Builds libgbm wrapper library

#### Build Process:
1. **preConfigure**: Sets up Xcode environment, copies dependencies
2. **preBuild**: Compiles Metal shaders
3. **buildPhase**: 
   - Compiles libgbm wrapper
   - Compiles all source files (.c and .m)
   - Links executable with all frameworks and libraries
4. **installPhase**: Creates app bundle, copies resources, generates Info.plist

### 3. Dependency Compilation Status

All dependencies should compile for iOS, Android, macOS. The build system uses:
- `buildModule.buildForMacOS` / `buildForIOS` / `buildForAndroid` for platform-specific builds
- `pkgs.pixman` for pixman (from nixpkgs)
- `pkgs.vulkan-headers` / `pkgs.vulkan-loader` for Vulkan support

## Current Status

✅ **Completed**:
- Converted CMakeLists.txt logic to Nix
- Created platform-specific builds (macos, ios, android)
- Metal shader compilation
- App bundle creation
- Info.plist generation
- Dependency setup

⚠️ **Needs Testing**:
- Full build of wawona-macos
- Full build of wawona-ios  
- Full build of wawona-android
- Verify all dependencies compile correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Test dependency builds**:
   ```bash
   nix build '.#libwayland-macos'
   nix build '.#libwayland-ios'
   nix build '.#libwayland-android'
   # Test other dependencies...
   ```

2. **Test Wawona builds**:
   ```bash
   nix build '.#wawona-macos'
   nix build '.#wawona-ios'
   nix build '.#wawona-android'
   ```

3. **Refine build if needed**:
   - Fix any compilation errors
   - Improve error handling in build scripts
   - Optimize build process

4. **Remove CMakeLists.txt** (once Nix build is verified):
   - Can be kept as reference initially
   - Remove once Nix build is fully working

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Manual compilation**: The current approach compiles files manually in a loop, which:
   - Doesn't handle file dependencies automatically
   - May have ordering issues
   - Error handling could be improved

2. **Build complexity**: Building a complex C/Objective-C project without CMake is challenging. Consider:
   - Using a generated Makefile
   - Using a build script with better dependency tracking
   - Keeping minimal CMake for complex parts (if needed)

3. **Path handling**: Need to ensure all paths are correctly resolved in build phases

## Files Modified

- `dependencies/wawona.nix` - Complete rewrite to pure Nix build system
- `dependencies/deps/*/macos.nix` - Updated to use Xcode auto-detection (already done)

## Files to Remove (after verification)

- `CMakeLists.txt` - No longer needed once Nix build is verified

Nice — this is a great (and thorny) area. Below I did a focused deep-dive on Vulkan drivers on Android with an emphasis on what matters for building a Wayland compositor that needs Vulkan (and for integrating with waypipe-rs). I include: how Android’s Vulkan stack is structured, the types of drivers you’ll encounter, buffer sharing and WSI considerations (crucial for a compositor), practical strategies, and concrete next steps + checks you can run on devices/emulators. I cite upstream sources you can follow for details.

---

# Quick summary (tl;dr)

* Android uses a Vulkan *loader + ICD* model like desktop systems; most runtime functionality comes from a GPU vendor ICD (closed-source on many devices) or from open-source Mesa drivers where available. ([Android Open Source Project][1])
* Common driver implementations on Android:

  * Vendor-provided closed drivers: Qualcomm (Adreno), ARM (Mali, though Mali has open PanVK work), Imagination (PowerVR), NVIDIA (Tegra).
  * Open-source Mesa-based drivers: Freedreno/Turnip (Adreno), Panfrost/PanVK (Mali), others (where ported to Android builds). ([Mesa 3D Documentation][2])
* For fallback/CPU rendering: Google’s SwiftShader is common (used by emulator and as a fallback driver). Useful for development/testing but slow. ([GitHub][3])
* For compositor work you must handle *external buffer* interop (AHardwareBuffer / dma-buf) and the appropriate Vulkan extensions (VK_ANDROID_external_memory_* and the AHB import/export APIs). Android exposes Android-specific Vulkan extensions for this. ([Vulkan Documentation][4])
* Wayland-specific surface support (VK_KHR_wayland_surface) exists in the Vulkan ecosystem and Android’s Vulkan metadata can list it — but presence and behavior depend on the platform/driver. You’ll probably need to map Wayland buffers to Android-native buffers (AHardwareBuffer) or implement a presentation path via VK_KHR_android_surface. ([Android Developers][5])

---

# 1) Android Vulkan stack — architecture & how drivers are discovered

* Android uses a Vulkan *loader* that enumerates *ICDs* (installable client drivers) and layers; Google maintains the Android-specific loader behavior and Android AOSP has documentation for implementing Vulkan on Android (discovery, layers, platform differences). The loader/ICD model means an application calls through the loader which dispatches to the vendor ICD for that device. This is the same conceptual model as Linux/Windows. ([Android Go Source][6])
* Practical consequence: whether Vulkan features you need are available depends on the *device’s ICD* and installed extensions. You must query extensions and features at runtime (vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties, vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties, vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2, etc.). ([Vulkan Documentation][7])

---

# 2) Types of Vulkan drivers you will meet on Android

A. **Vendor-provided GPU ICDs (closed-source/NPOTS):**

* Qualcomm Adreno, ARM Mali (vendor blobs or vendor-supplied), Imagination PowerVR, NVIDIA Tegra (SHIELD). These are the drivers typically shipping on phones/tablets and expose the best performance & proprietary extensions. For a production compositor you’ll target these first. ([Android Open Source Project][1])

B. **Open-source drivers (Mesa-family) on Android:**

* **Freedreno / Turnip** — open Vulkan driver for Adreno (effort to upstream Turnip into Mesa). Works well on some Adreno chips and is actively developed; many projects use it on Linux, and there are ports to Android in some projects. ([YouTube][8])
* **Panfrost / PanVK** — Mesa driver work for ARM Mali (PanVK = Vulkan part of Panfrost). Upstream status varies by Mali family & kernel support. ([Mesa 3D Documentation][2])
* **Why this matters:** If you control the Android image (custom ROM, embedded device), you can deploy Mesa ICDs and get usable Vulkan on hardware that vendors didn’t fully support. On stock phones you usually get vendor blobs only.

C. **Software implementations / fallbacks:**

* **SwiftShader** — CPU-based Vulkan implementation from Google. Built into Android emulator and sometimes used as a system fallback for devices/VMs that lack a GPU driver. Useful for testing compositor code and headless mode but not for performance. ([GitHub][3])

---

# 3) Buffer/IPC interop — the critical part for a compositor + waypipe

Your compositor needs to get client buffers into GPU memory and present them. On Android the usual primitives are:

* **AHardwareBuffer <-> Vulkan import/export**
  Vulkan exposes Android-specific external memory extensions so you can import `AHardwareBuffer` into Vulkan (`VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer` and the `VkImportAndroidHardwareBufferInfoANDROID` path). That lets Vulkan images be created from or exported to AHardwareBuffer objects. This is essential for compositor <-> client buffer sharing on Android. ([Vulkan Documentation][4])

* **dma-buf (file-descriptors) sharing:**
  On Linux/Wayland you typically pass dma-buf FDs. On Android the analogous mechanism is `AHardwareBuffer` (which can be backed by dma-buf under the hood on Linux kernels that support it). Interop with `dmabuf` depends on kernel/SoC (drivers must support exporting/importing). Many projects map between AHB and dma-buf for cross-process zero-copy. See the Khronos/Vulkan docs & community threads about problems/quirks when importing external buffers (format support, opaque external formats). ([Khronos Forums][9])

* **Wayland WSI (VK_KHR_wayland_surface) vs VK_KHR_android_surface:**

  * Vulkan has a `VK_KHR_wayland_surface` WSI extension for Wayland. The Vulkan spec allows using this where Wayland is the display system. Android has a different native surface extension (`VK_KHR_android_surface`). On devices that support it, `VK_KHR_wayland_surface` can be available (some Android Vulkan extension lists show it), but behavior will vary. For a Wayland compositor running *on top of Android*, you will likely need to map Wayland buffers to Android-native presentation mechanisms (AHardwareBuffer + VK_KHR_android_surface) unless you control the whole stack (i.e., run your Wayland compositor on a device image where Wayland is the primary compositor). ([Android Developers][5])

Practical notes:

* Importing an AHardwareBuffer into Vulkan can be *format-opaque* (driver-specific). You may find images usable only as sampled images, or restrictions on operations. Expect to handle per-device quirks. Community threads show errors when drivers reject certain imports — you must probe supported formats and fall back. ([Khronos Forums][9])

---

# 4) For waypipe-rs (it uses Vulkan) — specific things to consider

* **Cross-host buffer passing:** waypipe sends frame data over the network. The most efficient approach is to send handles/FDs for zero-copy GPU buffer sharing (dmabuf/AHB) and import them on the receiving side into Vulkan. On Android, that implies mapping incoming buffers into `AHardwareBuffer` or importing dmabuf FDs into Vulkan via the Android external memory extensions. Expect per-device support variance. ([Vulkan Documentation][4])
* **Fallback path:** when zero-copy import fails, fall back to CPU transfer (readback into CPU-visible staging buffer, packetize, send, reupload) — this is slower but more portable (SwiftShader on the receiver can be used to render). ([GitHub][3])
* **Synchronization & queue families:** importing external memory may impose constraints on usage flags and queue families; check `VkImageFormatProperties2` and the external memory capabilities. Drivers may require specific flags to be set or disallow certain combinations. ([LunarXchange][10])

---

# 5) Practical checklist & how to test target devices/emulators

1. **Probe runtime capabilities on the target:**

   * Query instance/device extensions and features at runtime: `vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties`, `vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties`, `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2`. Look for:

     * `VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer` (AHB import/export).
     * `VK_KHR_wayland_surface` and `VK_KHR_android_surface` availability.
   * This step tells you whether you can import AHB and whether Wayland WSI is present. (Always do this at startup.) ([Vulkan Documentation][7])

2. **Try SwiftShader as a controlled fallback** (emulator or dev device): it guarantees a Vulkan implementation for development/testing even without GPU ICD; good to validate your buffer import/export logic quickly. SwiftShader is used by the Android emulator. ([GitHub][3])

3. **Test importing AHardwareBuffer into Vulkan**:

   * Create an AHardwareBuffer (or receive one), import with `VkImportAndroidHardwareBufferInfoANDROID`, and test supported operations (sampled, color attachment, blit). Log errors and query `VkImageFormatProperties2` for support. Community reports show devices may accept imports only for sampling or have restricted layouts — implement fallback paths. ([Vulkan Documentation][11])

4. **If you control the image (embedded device / custom Android build):** consider shipping Mesa drivers (Turnip/PanVK) as ICDs to get a more open driver stack and easier debugging. For consumer phones you usually must rely on vendor ICDs. ([Phoronix][12])

5. **If you need Wayland clients to use Vulkan WSI**: you’ll either:

   * Use `VK_KHR_wayland_surface` if available on device and drivers; or
   * Translate Wayland buffer submission to Android-native surfaces (AHardwareBuffer + `VK_KHR_android_surface` presentation path) in your compositor. Expect to do buffer format negotiation and possibly color-space conversions. ([Vulkan Documentation][13])

---

# 6) Known pain points & gotchas

* **Driver variability & opaque formats:** vendors may implement only a subset of extensions or implement external formats opaquely (sample-only images, etc.). Test per-device and provide fallbacks. Community threads and StackOverflow show repeated issues importing external buffers. ([Khronos Forums][9])
* **Kernel/SoC support for dmabuf/AHB:** zero-copy across processes relies on kernel-level support (exporting dmabuf backing). On many phones/SoCs this is fine; on others it is not. If you need robust behavior, make sure kernels/vendors you target support the necessary features. ([GitHub][14])
* **Wayland on Android is not “first-class”**: Android is not a Wayland system by default. If you run a Wayland compositor *on top of Android*, you’re adding a composition layer that must interoperate with Android’s windowing and buffer systems. If you can run on a device image where Wayland is primary (embedded devices or custom Android builds where you control the whole stack), things are easier. ([FSU Nuclear Physics][15])

---

# 7) Concrete next steps I recommend (in order)

1. On your target device(s), run a small runtime probe program that:

   * Enumerates instance & device extensions.
   * Queries for `VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer` and `VK_KHR_wayland_surface` / `VK_KHR_android_surface`.
   * Attempts a simple `AHardwareBuffer` -> `vkImport` -> sample shader draw test.
     (This will quickly tell you which path is feasible.) ([Vulkan Documentation][7])

2. If zero-copy import works, implement the Wayland buffer-to-AHB mapping in your compositor and use Vulkan image import to present. If not, implement CPU fallback paths (staging reads/writes). ([Khronos Forums][9])

3. For development, use **SwiftShader** (emulator) to iterate on compositor code and waypipe integration before testing on hardware. ([GitHub][3])

4. If you control the device image and seek greater portability/debuggability, consider packaging/test-booting a Mesa-based ICD (Turnip / PanVK) for your SoC — it makes debugging and upstreaming much easier. ([Phoronix][12])

---

# Handy links (primary sources)

* Android / AOSP Vulkan documentation (architecture + implement-vulkan guidance). ([Android Open Source Project][16])
* Vulkan loader & architecture overview (loader/ICD on Android). ([Android Go Source][6])
* Panfrost / PanVK docs (open-source Mali Vulkan). ([Mesa 3D Documentation][2])
* SwiftShader (Google) — CPU Vulkan implementation. ([GitHub][3])
* Vulkan refpages for Android AHB import/export (`VkImportAndroidHardwareBufferInfoANDROID` / `VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer`). ([Vulkan Documentation][11])

---

If you want, I can immediately:

* produce a **minimal C/C++/Rust probe program** that enumerates Vulkan device extensions on an Android device and attempts a basic `AHardwareBuffer -> vkImport` cycle (I can produce ready-to-run NDK / ADB steps), or
* draft the **buffer import + fallback logic** skeleton for your compositor (pseudocode + error-handling paths for common driver quirks), or
* search for *device-specific notes* (e.g., Adreno exact Vulkan extension coverage per chipset, PanVK status for a particular Mali) for the specific devices you’ll target.

Which of those would help most next?

# Wayland on macOS (Darwin) - Research from ChatGPT

Wayland's core libraries can be built on macOS, but macOS lacks many Linux-specific interfaces. In practice Wayland's protocol library and tools compile on Darwin using shims. For example, MacPorts provides a Wayland port (v2023.01.28) that depends only on `epoll-shim`, `libffi`, and `libxml2` (plus build tools like clang, Meson, Ninja)[1]. The crucial missing piece on macOS is Linux's `epoll`: this is handled by using `epoll-shim`, a small library that implements epoll on top of BSD's `kqueue`. Epoll-shim has been "successfully used to port libinput, libevdev, Wayland and more software to FreeBSD"[2], and it supports macOS (tested on macOS 13.7.1)[3]. In short, a developer can compile Wayland on macOS today by installing epoll-shim and the other dependencies (Meson, Ninja, pkg-config, etc.)[1][2].

However, building the Wayland protocol libraries is only half the story. Running a real Wayland compositor on macOS is more complex. macOS has no DRM/KMS or Linux input stack; instead it uses the Quartz Compositor and Cocoa for windowing and events. Any Mac compositor must hook into Cocoa (for OpenGL/Metal drawing and input events). In fact, the Owl project demonstrates this approach: Owl is a Wayland compositor written in Objective-C that uses Cocoa. It "makes it possible to run Wayland clients inside OS X's native Quartz graphics environment" – essentially acting like an XQuartz or XWayland for Wayland[4]. Owl (and similar forks) show that a macOS Wayland compositor must translate Wayland surfaces into native Quartz windows and convert macOS input (NSEvents) into Wayland events.

In summary, Wayland on macOS requires:

- **Shimming Linux APIs** (using epoll-shim for event loops, and providing or emulating missing syscalls like `timerfd`/`signalfd`). In fact, porting Weston to Android already required removing Linux-only calls like `signalfd` and `timerfd` because Android's Bionic libc lacks them[5]; the same will hold for Darwin's libc.
- **Custom compositor code** on top of Cocoa. There are no ready-made compositors for macOS aside from experimental ones like Owl. A developer would have to write (or adapt) a compositor to use macOS graphics and window APIs.
- **Input device support**. Linux compositors use libinput and evdev; on macOS you'd instead use native input APIs (or port libinput via something like a wscons backend, but more likely just use Cocoa events). No out-of-the-box solution exists.

Despite these hurdles, the basic Wayland libraries can run on macOS. Maintained forks on GitHub (for example XQuartz's wayland mirror or Owl's wayland mirror) exist, and tools like MacPorts make installation straightforward[1][4]. Some low-level code (like epoll-shim) is already upstreamable and works across BSD/Darwin. But high-level support (graphics, input) must be handled by a compositor implementation for macOS.

## Dependencies and Portability

The Wayland protocol is implemented in a set of C libraries (`libwayland-client`, `libwayland-server`, etc.) with relatively few dependencies beyond basic infrastructure. Key build dependencies are a recent C compiler and build tools (Meson, Ninja, pkg-config)[6]. The only library dependencies are `libxml2` and `libffi` (both available on macOS), and an epoll-replacement for non-Linux systems. MacPorts' Wayland port explicitly lists `epoll-shim`, `libffi`, and `libxml2`[1]. On BSD/Darwin, `libudev` (Linux device enumeration) isn't needed for the protocol itself, though it would be needed if using libinput for input devices.

Notably, Wayland was designed for Linux kernel features (DRM/KMS, udev, evdev). On FreeBSD/OpenBSD, ports exist that reimplement these via kqueue or wscons. For example, `libinput-openbsd` uses wscons(4) and kqueue to mimic Linux input[7]. Epoll-shim works with FreeBSD's kqueue (and macOS's kqueue)[2]. Thus, in principle Wayland can be "ported" to any BSD-like system by providing these shims. In fact, epoll-shim's documentation explicitly mentions macOS support[3], and there are experimental Wayland ports on FreeBSD (via FreshPorts)[8]. The main missing pieces across non-Linux targets are the graphics and input backends (i.e. how buffers get to the screen, how keyboard/mouse events are read).

## Wayland on iOS

iOS presents even greater challenges. iOS (iPhone/iPad OS) is not a general-purpose Unix environment and does not allow third-party display servers. There is no X or Wayland at all; apps must use UIKit/Metal/OpenGL ES to render to the screen. Unlike macOS, you cannot spawn a rootless compositor to take over the display. In addition, iOS's system libraries lack many Linux APIs (similar to Android's Bionic). For example, iOS has no `epoll`, no `timerfd`/`signalfd` (only kqueue, and even that is limited), and the app sandbox prevents opening arbitrary Unix sockets without special entitlement.

In practical terms, running Wayland on iOS would mean writing a custom compositor within an iOS app (essentially a full-screen app that implements the Wayland server API), and using Core Animation/Metal to present client buffers. There is no public example of a Wayland port to iOS. The closest analogy is that macOS requires an Owl-like compositor; iOS would require an even more bespoke solution. Given the constraints, Wayland will not work on iOS out of the box – it would need a complete rewrite of input/output layers to use iOS APIs, and even then it may violate iOS's sandbox.

(For context, a similar effort on Android had to remove Linux-specific calls: Paalanen's Weston port to Android "completely remove[d] signal handling and timers from libwayland, because signalfd and timerfd … do not exist in Bionic"[5]. Darwin's libc lacks those too, so the same modifications would be needed on iOS.)

## Wayland on Android

Android is closer to Linux under the hood, but its graphics stack is very different. Vanilla Android uses the SurfaceFlinger compositor with an `ANativeWindow` interface, not X11 or Wayland. To run Wayland on Android, one typically uses the `libhybris` compatibility layer. In effect, libhybris provides a meta-EGL implementation that exposes Wayland's EGL extensions on top of Android's windowing. Projects like Sailfish OS (by Jolla) use this: a Wayland compositor runs on an Android device by rendering to an `ANativeWindow` provided by SurfaceFlinger.

In practice, developers have ported Weston to Android. Paalanen's proof-of-concept showed Weston driving an Android phone's framebuffer by writing an Android-specific backend, but it required heavy hacks: removing unsupported syscalls, using Android's gralloc and wrapper-libEGL, and killing SurfaceFlinger to take over the display[9][10]. More recently, Faith Ekstrand explains that libhybris works by implementing Wayland's EGL (`eglBindWaylandDisplayWL`) using Android's fences and ANativeWindow. This approach has succeeded enough that "Jolla (among others) is shipping devices" running Wayland on Android hardware[11].

However, fundamental mismatches remain. Android's EGL swap semantics conflict with Wayland's expectations. In Wayland, each `eglSwapBuffers()` must implicitly attach and commit a `wl_buffer` to the surface. But on Android, swapping an `ANativeWindow` can be delayed or even skipped (the driver may preserve the previous buffer), violating Wayland's assumption[12]. Ekstrand notes the "core collision" – "Android provides no real guarantees as to what a driver has to do inside of eglSwapBuffers", making the Wayland guarantee effectively impossible[12]. Libhybris hacks (like using sync fences) can mitigate this, but not without edge cases.

So, on Android you can compile Wayland and even run Weston via libhybris, but expect many issues. You will need to integrate with Android's HAL: use `ANativeWindow` for drawing, use Android's event loop or rewrite Wayland's loop, handle power/button events via JNI, etc. In short, porting Wayland to Android involves gluing Wayland to Android's graphics/input (as done in custom Android kernels or Sailfish builds). It is not plug-and-play. Still, the Collabora/Android Weston port[9] and libhybris efforts show it is possible on some devices.

## Work Required and Upstream Considerations

**macOS:** To run a Wayland compositor on macOS, you'll basically be developing a native app that speaks Wayland. You should expect to implement a custom graphics backend (using Cocoa or Metal) and translate input from NSEvents to Wayland. You can re-use the Wayland protocol library largely unmodified (with epoll-shim installed), but you will need to handle timing, signals, and file-descriptor polling using macOS mechanisms (dispatch sources, or shim libraries) instead of Linux syscalls. Concretely, this often means using the `epoll-shim` library (which is already on MacPorts) and possibly the accompanying interposition library to emulate `read`/`write` on `timerfd`/`signalfd`[2]. You would also link against `libxml2`/`libffi` (which are standard macOS libraries).

**iOS:** Running Wayland here is more like writing a Wayland-to-iOS adapter. You'd create an iOS app (probably with a single UIWindow) and implement the Wayland server logic inside it. You'd use Core Animation or Metal to composite client buffers into the window. Input (touch, keyboard) would be converted to Wayland pointer/keyboard events. Because iOS does not allow multiple top-level windows from one app, your compositor is the app. You must also compile a custom libc extension or shim for missing Linux APIs. In short, expect a huge amount of work: it's essentially writing a new Wayland compositor using iOS APIs. There is no existing example and it may run afoul of iOS app restrictions.

**Android:** You would use libhybris or similar. Typically you fork Wayland and Weston, add Android-specific backends, and integrate with the Android build system. Paalanen's Android port shows you'll patch out unsupported calls (no signalfd, etc.)[5], use the Android EGL and native window, and probably run as a root/System app (to kill the stock compositor). Getting input means reading from Android's event input (or using JNI to call into Java). Essentially, building Wayland/Weston on Android is possible but requires a complete Android-optimized build environment (usually done inside AOSP or using an Android tree)[13]. Upstream Wayland/Weston do not officially support Android, so this would be a fork with many patches.

**Differences from macOS and iOS:** On Windows/macOS/iOS/Android (the common desktop/mobile systems), graphical apps normally use the system's built-in compositor. Each of those systems has its own windowing and event model, which is "relatively similar" across them, whereas Wayland's model is quite different[14]. For example, placing windows, handling popups/menus, global shortcuts, etc. are not defined by core Wayland (they rely on compositor extensions). Mac and Windows expect clients to call specific OS APIs, not a generic protocol socket. Wayland on these targets would feel foreign: "Wayland is the odd one out" compared to the native APIs on macOS/iOS/Android[14]. In practice, to port to those targets you have to embed the Wayland compositor into the native UI framework (as Owl does on macOS[4]) rather than replacing it wholesale.

## Forking and Upstream

Wayland is open-source (MIT license), so you are free to fork and modify it. Many developers maintain their own forks for specific platforms (e.g. XQuartz's wayland mirror or owl-compositor's Wayland mirror). You can host your fork on GitHub or elsewhere. The official upstream is on freedesktop.org (GitLab), but GitHub forks are common.

If you create Mac- or mobile-specific patches, you could propose upstreaming those that make sense (for example, epoll-shim integration could benefit BSD users). In fact, epoll-shim was eventually integrated into some BSD build environments[2]. However, large platform-specific changes (like a Cocoa backend) would not be merged into core Wayland; they belong in separate compositor projects. Upstream Wayland is focused on cross-Linux improvements.

In summary: Yes, fork Wayland and Wayland-compositor repos for your project and host on GitHub. Use GitHub for issue tracking and collaboration if you prefer; just be aware the main Wayland project uses GitLab. Make liberal use of existing shims (epoll-shim, libhybris) and study previous ports (Owl on macOS[4], Collabora's Android port[9]) to guide your implementation.

## Sources

Documentation and ports (MacPorts, FreshPorts) of Wayland show the dependencies and build status on macOS[1][2]. The Owl compositor README describes running Wayland clients on macOS/Quartz[4]. Paalanen's blog and Ekstrand's analysis describe the challenges of running Weston/Wayland on Android[5][12]. The Avalonia project notes the fundamental API differences between Wayland and desktop/mobile systems[14]. These sources underline that while the core Wayland libraries can be built on non-Linux systems, full functionality requires substantial platform-specific work[1][4][5].

# Waypipe-Rust and Cross-Platform Graphics - Research from ChatGPT

Waypipe is a Wayland proxy that forwards rendering from a remote client to a local compositor. In its default (GPU) mode, the remote side renders with GPU acceleration and sends the frame as a Linux DMABUF buffer or video bitstream. On the local side, Waypipe reconstructs the image from DMABUF buffers or by decoding the video stream and feeds it into the compositor[1][2]. The Rust reimplementation of Waypipe ("waypipe-rs") uses Vulkan and FFmpeg for DMABUF handling and video encoding[2][3]. Porting waypipe-rs to non-Linux platforms (macOS, iOS, Android) requires dealing with differences in event loops, buffer sharing, and video codecs:

- **Event loop (epoll)**: Wayland and Waypipe expect Linux's epoll. On Darwin (macOS/iOS), use an epoll shim (e.g. [jiixyj/epoll-shim]) that implements epoll via kqueue[4]. This is a known approach for porting Wayland itself to macOS. On Android (Linux kernel), native epoll is available.
- **Wayland libraries**: You must build or port the Wayland (libwayland) stack for each platform. For macOS/iOS, projects like Owl or Wawona provide ports of Wayland/mesa. Once libwayland is available, waypipe-rs can be built against it (for example via Meson/Cargo). On Android, you can compile with NDK or in a Linux container (e.g. Waydroid environment).
- **Desktop compositor**: The local machine needs a Wayland compositor. On macOS/iOS, this means running a custom compositor (like Owl/Wawona) that uses Cocoa/Metal backends. Waypipe-rs simply acts as a Wayland client to that compositor, so the compositor must support the protocols needed. On Android, a Wayland compositor can run as an app or service (e.g. Weston via Waydroid).

## macOS and iOS: DMABUF & Video

On macOS (and similarly iOS), the Linux DMABUF mechanism and libgbm (for buffer allocation) do not exist. In practice this means GPU mode is not directly supported. The common workaround is to disable GPU/DMABUF and fall back to shared-memory (wl_shm) rendering. The Waypipe manpage explicitly notes that you can turn off DMABUF support (or use --no-gpu) to avoid relying on Linux graphics libraries[5]. In fact, others have ported Waypipe to Linux-based phones by disabling DMABUF entirely – one SailfishOS packaging disables both DMABUF and VAAPI due to missing libraries[6]. By analogy, on macOS/iOS you would compile or invoke waypipe-rs without DMABUF; the Rust code will then send raw pixel diffs over the network instead of GPU buffers.

If GPU acceleration is still desired, the Rust code's Vulkan path could run on Apple hardware using MoltenVK (Vulkan-on-Metal). Waypipe-rs's DMABUF handling is implemented with Vulkan and Ash (a Rust Vulkan binding)[2], so in theory MoltenVK allows that code to run. However, the local compositor must accept the buffers. Since macOS does not support Linux DMABUF at all, one would still need to convert incoming images into something the compositor accepts (e.g. upload to a Metal texture or use wl_shm). In short, real DMABUF buffer sharing isn't natively possible on macOS/iOS, so most deployments simply use software mode (or video streaming) for remote apps.

For video encoding, Waypipe-rs uses FFmpeg's hardware encoders (e.g. Vulkan extensions) by default[2]. On Apple platforms you can compile FFmpeg with VideoToolbox support, enabling the H.264/HEVC encoders on Apple Silicon or Intel[2]. In practice, you could build waypipe-rs with FFmpeg and then use --video=hw or --video=sw. If GPU encoding isn't available, software encoding (x264) still works. The result is fed via the same Wayland protocol.

Summary for macOS/iOS: Build waypipe-rs against a Mac port of Wayland (e.g. Owl), using epoll-shim for event loops[4]. Disable or avoid DMABUF (--no-gpu) since macOS has no Linux buffer sharing[5][6]. Use the WL_SHM path (CPU copy) to send frames. The Vulkan/FFmpeg code in waypipe-rs can run via MoltenVK and VideoToolbox for acceleration, but this is optional and the compositor must support the final pixel format. Notably, the Rust DMABUF/video implementation is very FFI-heavy and specific to Linux graphics (it's ~4000 lines of code beyond the C version)[3][7], so expect to disable or adapt those parts on Apple systems.

## Android: Vulkan, AHardwareBuffer and Video

Android is Linux-based, so it inherently supports epoll and (in principle) DMABUF. Recent Android versions provide the AHardwareBuffer API for GPU buffers, which is essentially Android's equivalent of DMABUF. AHardwareBuffers are zero-copy shared memory that can be passed between processes[8]. They can be imported into Vulkan via the VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer extension[9]. In practice, a Wayland compositor on Android (such as Wayland support in Waydroid or other stacks) can use AHardwareBuffer under the hood. Thus, waypipe-rs's Vulkan/DMABUF path can work: you send buffers via Linux DMABUF, and the local compositor (if it supports linux-dmabuf protocol) could import them as AHardwareBuffers.

Key points for Android:

- **Event loop**: native epoll (no shim needed).
- **DMABUF**: likely available via AHardwareBuffer/Vulkan. The NDK docs state that passing an AHardwareBuffer between processes creates a "shared view of the same region of memory"[8], and Vulkan can access it as external memory[9]. This means the zero-copy pipeline is possible.
- **Graphics**: Vulkan and OpenGL ES are supported on Android. Waypipe-rs's Vulkan code can use the Android Vulkan loader. If DMABUF fails or isn't supported by the compositor, you can fall back to WL_SHM (software).
- **Video**: FFmpeg can be built with Android support. You could use software codecs or possibly Android's MediaCodec through FFmpeg's mediacodec (not built-in to waypipe, but would be a separate integration). At worst, purely software H.264 encoding works.

In summary for Android, the path is similar to Linux desktop. You compile waypipe-rs in an Android-friendly way (maybe via Termux or as part of a Wayland APK). Because the kernel is Linux, you can use GPU/DMA mode or --video mode just like on PC. The Android AHardwareBuffer mechanism[8][9] means buffers can be shared across processes efficiently, so Waypipe-rs's Vulkan+DMABUF logic has an analog on Android. The main effort is ensuring the Wayland compositor on Android advertises the linux-dmabuf protocol (or wl_shm fallback otherwise).

## Practical Steps and Caveats

- **Building Waypipe-rs**: On macOS/iOS, first port Wayland core (e.g. via Owl's repos or homebrew), then build and link epoll-shim[4]. Use Cargo/meson to compile waypipe. On Android, cross-compile or use an NDK build for the Linux/Bionic environment.
- **Running mode**: The local side (mac/iOS/Android) runs waypipe in client mode (as the compositor is local). The Linux side runs it in server mode. Use SSH or sockets to connect them as usual.
- **Buffer mode**: If the local compositor does not support linux-dmabuf, use waypipe --no-gpu (SW mode). This is effectively what the SailfishOS package does[6]. On Linux or Android where DMABUF works, you can use GPU mode or --video.
- **Video options**: If you need better performance, try --video=hw (hardware encode on remote) and make sure the receiving side has decode support. On macOS/iOS, hardware encode via VideoToolbox is supported by FFmpeg, but the local compositor just receives the final image pixels.
- **Testing**: Start with simple clients (terminal, glxgears) to verify basic pipeline. Watch for errors about missing protocols (zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1, etc.). Adjust Waypipe options based on failures.

In essence, using waypipe-rs on non-Linux targets is feasible but requires careful handling of the Linux-specific parts. Epoll-shim solves event loop portability[4]. The lack of DMABUF on Darwin means generally using software fallbacks[5]. Android's AHardwareBuffer and Vulkan support cover the zero-copy path[8][9]. The Rust code's use of Vulkan and FFmpeg suggests that with those libraries available (e.g. MoltenVK and VideoToolbox on Apple, Vulkan and NDK on Android), the full feature set (diffs, encoding) can be retained[2][3]. Expect, however, that the DMABUF/video components are low-level (unsafe FFI) and platform-conditional, so testing and conditional compilation may be needed[7].

## Sources

Official Waypipe docs and manpage, porting notes from the Waypipe-Rust rewrite, and platform documentation. For example, the Waypipe manpage notes disabling DMABUF/--no-gpu for compatibility[5], the SailfishOS forum confirms DMABUF is often disabled on mobile[6], and the Android NDK docs describe AHardwareBuffer zero-copy sharing[8][9]. The Rust rewrite blog explains the Vulkan/DMABUF approach in detail[2][3]. Epoll-shim documentation shows how Wayland has been ported using kqueue on macOS[4]. Together, these highlight the major technical adjustments needed.

# Waypipe-RS (Rust) Overview, DMA-BUF and Video - Research from ChatGPT

Waypipe is a proxy for Wayland clients (like SSH X forwarding for Wayland). The Rust rewrite of Waypipe ("waypipe-rs") implements the same proxy logic but uses Vulkan for DMA-BUF buffer handling and FFmpeg for optional video encoding[1][2]. By default Waypipe tries to use GPU-acceleration: as one blog notes, "waypipe enables GPU acceleration on the remote side, extracts the result as a texture via DMABUF"[2]. In the Rust port, DMABUF support was re-implemented with Vulkan instead of libgbm[3], and hardware video encoding is done via recent Vulkan video extensions through FFmpeg's encoder/decoder[4]. In practice on Linux this means Wayland clients use the `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1` protocol, and Waypipe transfers those GPU buffers (or their diffs) over the network.

## macOS Support

macOS does not natively support Linux's DRM or DMA-BUF APIs. To run Wayland clients on macOS you need a compatible compositor (e.g. the Owl compositor). Owl is an Objective-C/Cocoa Wayland compositor that lets you "run Wayland clients inside OS X's native Quartz graphics environment"[5]. To use it you must compile the Wayland libraries and an "epoll-shim" (on BSD/macOS you replace Linux epoll with kqueue) – the Owl GitHub org provides these macOS ports of libwayland, etc.[6]. Once built, Owl.app can display Wayland apps on macOS.

However, without Linux GPU APIs, the GPU path in Waypipe effectively falls back. In fact on similar systems (e.g. SailfishOS), packages disable Waypipe's DMA-BUF and VAAPI video support due to missing `libgbm`/`libvaapi`[7]. On macOS you likewise lack libgbm and the standard hw video path. One strategy is to use a Vulkan-on-Metal driver (such as LunarG's KosmicKrisp) on Apple Silicon[8]. KosmicKrisp provides Vulkan 1.3 on macOS/Metal, so the Waypipe Vulkan code can run (copying and encoding buffers via GPU). This allows the Rust code to process buffers much like on Linux (the DMABUF data itself is still copied into a Vulkan image on the Mac side). In effect, you can use "GPU acceleration" via Vulkan on Metal[8], even though there's no true DMA-FD sharing. If Vulkan isn't available, Waypipe-rs will use shared-memory copies (the `--no-gpu` path).

For video, on macOS/iOS one must supply FFmpeg or similar libraries. The Rust Waypipe dynamically loads `libavcodec`/`libavutil`, so you can install FFmpeg (e.g. via Homebrew) or use a mobile FFmpeg kit. Hardware H.264 support on Apple could come from VideoToolbox; FFmpeg can be built with `-hwaccel videotoolbox`. In any case, video encoding in waypipe would work as on Linux once FFmpeg is present[4]. (Note: without libvaapi on macOS, you rely on other hw encoders. Sailfish examples disabled video for lack of VAAPI[7], but macOS has its own APIs.)

## iOS Support

iOS is similar to macOS but more restrictive. You could embed a Wayland compositor in an iOS app (using UIKit/Cocoa Touch). In principle Owl or a similar compositor could be ported to iOS. Rust supports the `aarch64-apple-ios` target, but you must cross-compile all C libs (Wayland, epoll-shim, Vulkan loader, FFmpeg) for iOS. Like macOS, iOS has no Linux DMA-BUF or VAAPI; the Vulkan/MoltenVK route is possible (MoltenVK runs on iOS). Thus Waypipe-rs on iOS would essentially use shared-memory buffers or Vulkan on Metal for GPU paths, just as on macOS. DMA-FD from Linux won't work; one would treat those buffers as generic image data. Video on iOS would use FFmpeg or Apple's encoder (FFmpegKit provides iOS packages). In summary, the behavior is the same as macOS: no true DMA-BUF, but you can enable the Vulkan+FFmpeg features via alternate APIs[8][1], while disabling/removing Linux-specific bits (which Sailfish did for lack of GBM[7]).

## Android Support

Android runs on a Linux kernel, so DMA-BUF is available (e.g. gralloc buffers). If you have a Wayland compositor on Android (such as Waydroid's Weston/Wayfire or a custom app), Waypipe-rs can run on Android as it does on desktop Linux. You would cross-compile for Android (via the NDK, target `aarch64-linux-android` or `armv7`) and build libwayland, Vulkan loader, FFmpeg, etc. The GPU path works normally: Android's GPU drivers support `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1` for buffer passing. Thus Waypipe can accelerate via DMABUF on Android just like Linux. Video encoding on Android can be done via FFmpeg (NDK build) or Android's MediaCodec (FFmpegKit also supports Android).

One thing to watch: Rust's foreign types differ by platform. For example, C's `char` may map to signed vs unsigned differently[9], so the Rust bindings should use `std::ffi::c_char` for portability[9]. In practice you'd ensure all C ABI types (`c_char`, `c_int`, etc.) are handled correctly when cross-compiling to Android vs Apple.

## Summary: What to Port and How

In summary, to use waypipe-rs from Linux onto macOS/iOS/Android, you need:

- A Wayland server on the target device (e.g. Owl on macOS/iOS, or a Wayland compositor on Android) that supports `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1` and basic protocols. Owl's instructions emphasize building Wayland and epoll-shim for macOS[6].
- Vulkan (KosmicKrisp/MoltenVK) if you want GPU acceleration: this satisfies the Vulkan-based DMABUF/video code in waypipe[1][8]. Without it, use `--no-gpu`.
- FFmpeg libraries (or OS video codecs) for the video feature. You can compile FFmpeg for each platform or embed a prebuilt kit. The Rust code will load `libavcodec` at runtime[4].
- For macOS/iOS: expect that Waypipe's DMA-BUF and hardware video flags may default to off (as on Sailfish)[7], so you must handle buffers in software or via Vulkan.
- For Android: treat it like a Linux desktop – install Vulkan (most devices have it) and FFmpeg via NDK. DMA-BUF behaves normally.

Rust's porting is straightforward as long as dependencies are met. The key is replacing Linux-specific bits (GBM, VAAPI) with equivalent paths on each OS. The cited examples show that Waypipe-rs's use of Vulkan/FFmpeg makes it fundamentally portable, relying on cross-platform GPU interfaces[1]. Just compile the C libraries and link against them. With those in place, Waypipe-rs can run Linux Wayland clients and display them on your macOS/iOS/Android compositor, even though the underlying buffer passing is different on each OS.

## Settings Key Reference

All settings are stored using the following keys in their respective preference systems:

### Android (SharedPreferences)
- Keys use camelCase (e.g., `autoScale`, `respectSafeArea`, `waypipeDisplay`)

### iOS/macOS (NSUserDefaults)
- Keys use PascalCase (e.g., `AutoScale`, `RespectSafeArea`, `WaypipeDisplay`)

### Unified Keys
The following keys are unified across all platforms (with automatic case conversion):
- `AutoScale` / `autoScale`
- `ColorOperations` / `colorOperations`
- `NestedCompositorsSupport` / `nestedCompositorsSupport`
- `MultipleClients` / `multipleClients`
- All `Waypipe*` keys (including `WaypipeRemoteCommand`, `WaypipeCustomScript`)

---

## Platform-Specific Behavior

### Android
- Force Server-Side Decorations: Always enabled (not user-configurable)
- Show macOS Cursor: Always disabled (not applicable)
- Swap CMD with ALT: Always disabled (not applicable)
- Socket Path: Automatically set to `${cacheDir}/waypipe` (read-only)
- Multiple Clients: Default disabled

### iOS (iPhone/iPad)
- Force Server-Side Decorations: Not available
- Show macOS Cursor: Not available
- Respect Safe Area: Available (default enabled)
- Swap CMD with ALT: Available (default enabled)
- Socket Path: Automatically set to `${NSTemporaryDirectory()}/waypipe` (read-only)
- Multiple Clients: Default disabled

### macOS
- Force Server-Side Decorations: Available (default enabled)
- Show macOS Cursor: Available (default disabled)
- Respect Safe Area: Not available
- Swap CMD with ALT: Available (default enabled)
- Socket Path: Automatically set to `${NSTemporaryDirectory()}/waypipe` (read-only)
- Multiple Clients: Default enabled

---

## Legacy Settings Migration

The following legacy settings keys are automatically migrated to their new unified names:

- `AutoRetinaScaling` → `AutoScale`
- `ColorSyncSupport` → `ColorOperations`
- `SwapCmdAsCtrl` → `SwapCmdWithAlt`

Migration happens automatically when settings are accessed. Old keys are preserved for backward compatibility but new keys take precedence.

---

## Removed Settings

The following settings have been removed and are no longer available:

- **Use Metal 4 for Nested**: Removed (implementation detail, not user-configurable)
- **Waypipe-rs Support**: Removed (always enabled, not a toggle)
- **Enable TCP Listener**: Removed (always enabled if Waypipe is enabled)
- **Swap CMD with Ctrl**: Removed (replaced by Swap CMD with ALT)

---

## Notes

- Settings changes take effect immediately on Android (via the Apply button)
- Settings changes on iOS/macOS take effect when the app is restarted or when the compositor detects changes
- Platform-specific settings (like Socket Path) are automatically managed and cannot be modified by users
- XWayland Support is visible but disabled on all platforms - it may be enabled in future versions

# Wawona Source Code Organization

## Overview

Wawona is a Wayland compositor supporting **iOS**, **macOS**, and **Android**. The codebase uses:
- Platform conditionals (`#ifdef`) for platform-specific code
- Shared source files compiled for all platforms
- Nix-managed build system defining which files compile per platform

## Understanding `protocols/` vs `compositor_implementations/`

### `src/protocols/` - Auto-Generated Bindings

These files are **auto-generated by `wayland-scanner`** from `.xml` protocol definitions:

| File Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `*.xml` | Wayland protocol XML definitions (source of truth) |
| `*-protocol.h` | Generated C header with interface definitions |
| `*-protocol.c` | Generated C code with message serialization |

**Example:** `xdg-shell.xml` → `xdg-shell-protocol.h` + `xdg-shell-protocol.c`

These files define **what** the protocol messages are, not **how** to handle them.

### `src/compositor_implementations/` - Actual Implementations

These files contain the **actual logic** for handling protocol requests:

| File | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `xdg_shell.c` | ✅ **Real** | XDG shell window management |
| `wayland_shm.c` | ✅ **Real** | Shared memory buffers (uses libwayland built-in) |

## Platform Conditionals Reference

### Common Macros

```c
// Apple platforms (iOS + macOS)
#ifdef __APPLE__

// iOS specifically
#if TARGET_OS_IPHONE || TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR

// macOS specifically  
#if !TARGET_OS_IPHONE && !TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR

// Android
#ifdef __ANDROID__

// Vulkan enabled
#if HAVE_VULKAN
```

### Per-File Platform Usage

| Directory | Files | Platforms |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| `core/` | All `.m` files | iOS, macOS (Objective-C) |
| `core/` | `.c` files | All (via conditionals) |
| `rendering/` | `metal_*.m` | iOS, macOS |
| `rendering/` | `vulkan_renderer.m` | iOS, macOS (optional) |
| `rendering/` | `android_dmabuf.c` | Android only |
| `ui/` | All files | iOS, macOS |
| `input/` | `input_handler.m` | iOS, macOS (has conditionals) |
| `android/` | All files | Android only |
| `compat/ios/` | All files | iOS only |
| `compat/macos/` | All files | macOS only |

---

## Build System Source Lists

Defined in `dependencies/wawona.nix`:

### `commonSources` (Shared across all Apple platforms)
- Core compositor logic
- Protocol implementations  
- Protocol bindings
- Rendering (Metal)
- Input handling
- UI components

### `iosSources` = `commonSources` + iOS-specific:
- `WawonaKernelTests.m/h`
- `WawonaLauncherClient.m/h`
- `color-management-v1-protocol.c`

### `macosSources` = `commonSources` minus:
- `vulkan_renderer.m/h` (excluded currently)
- `WawonaSettings.c` (uses `.m` version)

### `androidSources` = filtered `commonSources`:
- Only `.c` files (no Objective-C)
- Excludes Apple-specific files
- Plus: `android_jni.c`, `android_dmabuf.c`, `egl_buffer_handler.c`

---

## Cleanup Recommendations

### 1. Remove Pure Stubs
These files only contain empty functions and can be deleted:

```bash
# Candidates for deletion (verify they're not referenced)
src/compositor_implementations/wayland_gtk_shell.c    # Stub only
src/compositor_implementations/wayland_gtk_shell.h
src/compositor_implementations/wayland_plasma_shell.c # Stub only  
src/compositor_implementations/wayland_plasma_shell.h
src/compositor_implementations/wayland_qt_extensions.c # Stub only
src/compositor_implementations/wayland_qt_extensions.h
src/compositor_implementations/wayland_drm.c          # Stub only (we use dmabuf)
src/compositor_implementations/wayland_drm.h
```

### 2. Consolidate Protocol Stubs
`wayland_protocol_stubs.c` contains many `return NULL` stubs. Consider:
- Remove stubs for protocols we'll never implement (GTK, Plasma, Qt)
- Keep stubs for protocols we plan to implement later

### 3. Add Platform Markers to Headers
Add clear documentation at the top of files:

```c
// wayland_output.c
// Platform: ALL (iOS, macOS, Android)
// Description: Wayland output/display management
```

### 4. Reorganize by Platform
Consider moving platform-specific code:

```
src/
├── shared/              # Cross-platform code
│   ├── compositor/      # Protocol implementations
│   ├── protocols/       # Generated bindings
│   └── input/           # Input handling
├── apple/               # iOS + macOS shared
│   ├── rendering/       # Metal rendering
│   └── ui/              # Objective-C UI
├── ios/                 # iOS only
│   ├── compat/          # iOS compatibility
│   └── extensions/      # App extensions
├── macos/               # macOS only
│   └── compat/          # macOS stubs
└── android/             # Android only
    ├── jni/             # JNI bridge
    └── rendering/       # EGL/Android rendering
```

### 5. Document Stub Protocols

Create a tracking file for protocol implementation status:

```markdown
# Protocol Implementation Status

## Fully Implemented
- [x] xdg-shell (xdg_shell.c)
- [x] wl_shm (wayland_shm.c)
- [x] wl_output (wayland_output.c)
...

## Partially Implemented
- [ ] zwp_primary_selection (basic structure only)
...

## Not Planned
- [ ] gtk_shell1 (GTK-specific, not needed)
- [ ] org_kde_plasma_shell (KDE-specific, not needed)
```

---

## Quick Reference: What To Look At

| You want to... | Look at... |
|----------------|------------|
| Understand window management | `compositor_implementations/xdg_shell.c` |
| Add new protocol support | Create in `compositor_implementations/`, bind in `WawonaCompositor.m` |
| Modify iOS-specific code | Files with `TARGET_OS_IPHONE` |
| Modify macOS-specific code | Files with `!TARGET_OS_IPHONE && !TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR` |
| Modify Android code | `src/android/` + files with `__ANDROID__` |
| Add rendering features | `src/rendering/` (Metal on Apple, EGL on Android) |
| Change input handling | `src/input/input_handler.m` + `wayland_seat.c` |

---

## Summary

- **`protocols/`** = Auto-generated from XML (don't edit `.c`/`.h` files manually)
- **`compositor_implementations/`** = Your actual protocol handlers
- Most stubs exist for protocol completeness, not functionality
- Platform selection is done via C preprocessor + Nix build lists


==> todo.md <==
# Wawona Compositor Todo

- [ ] Open Source the project. Hello?
- [ ] Implement additional Wayland protocol extensions
- [ ] Add multi-touch protocol.. 
- [ ] and trackpad input style vs touch option in compositor settings.
- [ ] Create Wawona Compositor's seamless waypipe configuration interface for ios/android

### Compilation Status (Completed)
- [x] **Architecture**: `wawona.nix` acts as the primary driver, calling CMake with Nix-provided environment and dependencies.
- [x] **macOS**: Builds `wawona-macos` using custom Xcode wrapper (SDK 26) and links Nix-built dependencies (libwayland, ffmpeg, etc.).
- [x] **iOS**: Cross-compiles `wawona-ios` using Xcode toolchain and iOS SDK 26, linking ios-compiled dependencies.
- [x] **Android**: Cross-compiles `wawona-android` using NDK r27c, linking android-compiled dependencies.

### Build System & Multiplexing (Completed)
- [x] **Multiplexed Runner**: `nix run` (default app) launches a `tmux` session that builds all 3 platforms in parallel.
- [x] **Per-Platform Builds**: Available via `nix build .#wawona-macos`, `nix build .#wawona-ios`, `nix build .#wawona-android`.
- [x] **Dependency Management**: All dependencies (libwayland, waypipe, etc.) are hermetically built by Nix and exposed to CMake.

### Usage
- Run all builds: `nix run`
- Run specific build: `nix build .#wawona-<platform>`
